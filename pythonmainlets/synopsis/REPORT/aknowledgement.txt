I would like to express my special thanks and gratitude to my
teacher Mrs. Krishna Singh for guiding me immensely through
the course of my project.

My sincere thanks go to our principal Rev. Father Thomas
Maniparambil who gave me the golden opportunity to do this
wonderful project titled “Employee and Leave Management
System”, which helped me in doing a lot of research and learn
many new things in the related subject.

Last but not the least, I would also like to thank my parents and
fellow batchmates who helped me in completing the project
within the stipulated time period with utmost efficiency.
